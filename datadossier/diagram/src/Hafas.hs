We work on all the data points belonging to a tram line and partition them into ordered segments, which correspond to uninterrupted paths in the final graphic.

-- - Every path contains only data points of one tripId.
-- - There can be multiple paths with the same tripId.
-- - The data points in each path are sorted by time.
-- - No path has a gap, where the points are more than a certain time/geodistance apart.
