-- | A lot of logic happens here, as the raw data is in no good shape for our use case. We work on all the data points belonging to a tram line and partition them into ordered segments, which correspond to uninterrupted paths in the final graphic. This partitioning is non-trivial, as the following conditions must be true:
-- - Every path contains only data points of one tripId.
-- - There can be multiple paths with the same tripId.
-- - The data points in each path are sorted by time.
-- - No path has a gap, where the points are more than a certain time/geodistance apart.
